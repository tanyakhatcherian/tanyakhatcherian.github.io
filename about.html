    Hello! My name is Tanya Khatcherian. I'm a second year student at George Brown College studying Interaction Design. Currently, I am very interested in graphic design and branding. I also enjoy learning about 3D modeling and animation. During quarantine, you can find me spending too much time on Genshin Impact or Stardew Valley.
